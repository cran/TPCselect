Title: Variable Selection via Threshold Partial Correlation
Version: 0.8.3
Author: Cynthia Shao and Runze Li
Maintainer: Cynthia Shao <cynyu.shao@gmail.com>
Description: A threshold partial correlation approach to selecting 
             important variables in linear models of L. and others (2017) at
             <doi:10.5705/ss.202015.0473>, and in partial linear models
             of L. and others (2018) at <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2018.06.005>. 
             This package also extends the PC-simple algorithm of
             B. and others (2010) at <doi:10.1093/biomet/asq008> to 
             partial linear models.
